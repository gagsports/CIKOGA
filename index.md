 For travel, we'll share duties of car pooling and gas cost based on US GSA rate. Guests and visitors are welcome to join any event at any time but please remember that the space is limited and priority always goes to tour members. 

  We're actively seeking the best deal for the best courses across Midwest. If you find a good deal on a nice course, please let us know. Also, if you'd like to sponsor our organization, we'll gladly accept your contribution and will be acknowledged on our website.

  We strictly follow USGA rules and local rules. For example, no gimmes, mulligans, and cheating are allowed. A player should finish every hole with no maximum score. Every lost ball will be counted as a penalty. Please bring maximum 14 clubs. Score cards must be signed and submitted to the rule official at the end of the round.
